DESCRIPTION:

	Background:
	Queues are essential data strctures for operating systems and Xinu is no exception. The ready queue is used to order processes for CPU scheduling, the sleep queue holds a number of processes that are sleeping and waiting on the timer, other wait queues hold processes that are waiting for I/O to return, and each semaphore has a queue of processes waiting on it.

	Program:
	Ready Queue will run five processes using cooperative scheduling meaning It will run process 1 and print, then process 2 then print, then process 3 and so forth. They will alternate/share because as we know a ready queue is "used to order processes for CPU scheduling".
